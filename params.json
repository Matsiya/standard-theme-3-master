{"name":"Standard Theme 3","tagline":"Unofficial fork of Standard Theme 3 from 8BIT","body":"![](https://copy.com/caYglVSrmWIwfUB4)\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Standard Theme 3 wiki! I've gone through the Standard Theme support forums and have cloned as much information as I can for this wiki. Click on the *Pages* tab at the top to see all of the documentation.\r\n\r\n*Note:* I did not work for 8BIT or Standard Theme. I'm a user just like you that really likes Standard and want to do my part to help keep it alive. If you are interested in helping to maintain the code base and improve it, let me know.\r\n\r\n**Things I'd like to eventually do:**\r\n* Update the core to Bootstrap 3.\r\n* Add support for all WordPress core post formats.\r\n* Change the name if this is able to be monetized through Child Themes. Core would likely remain free.\r\n* Replace core social media icons with larger icons.\r\n* Replace Standard Theme logos in Ad Widgets.\r\n* Add new Page Templates.\r\n* Add additional Widget areas.\r\n* Replace image file icons with Glyphicon or Font Awesome font icons.\r\n\r\n**Want to help make some of this happen?**\r\n* This project needs someone with better PHP skills than I have.\r\n* This project needs someone with JavaScript skills (I have none).\r\n* Submit ideas for page templates or submit completed page templates you've made.\r\n* Submit new child themes.\r\n* Fork the project and submit fixes if you know of any bugs.\r\n\r\n**What I won't be doing right now.**\r\n* Providing direct support. If you need help with something, you're on your own right now. I'll be glad to help out or do custom site design or updates if you want to [hire me](www.create156.com).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
